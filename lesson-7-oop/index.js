// 1. Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include:
// a) question itself
// b) the answers from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here, array, object, etc.)
// c) correct answer (I would use a number for this)

// 2. Create a couple of questions using the constructor

// 3. Store them all inside an array

// 4. Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers (each answer should have a number) (Hint: write a method for the Question objects for this task).

// 5. Use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer such as you displayed it on Task 4.

// 6. Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or not (Hint: write another method for this).

// 7. Suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code. So make sure that all your code is private and doesn't interfere with the other programmerâ€™s code (Hint: we learned a special technique to do exactly that).
